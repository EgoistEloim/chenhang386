    summary: |
      I have led the development of critical machine learning models and systems that power content understanding and trust & safety features, significantly enhancing the platform's ability to personalize content while ensuring user safety. My work focuses on building large-scale multi-modality models that process vision, text, and audio data, contributing to hundreds of millions of views, double-digit percentage user growth, and a substantial reduction in user reports globally. 

      In addition to my contributions to the core recommendation system, I spearhead efforts in developing robust content understanding systems using large language models (LLMs), playing a key role in improving content ranking and user engagement. As a technical lead, I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, including backend and infrastructure engineers, to deploy machine learning models efficiently at scale, while ensuring that these systems support diverse use cases such as content personalization, integrity, and compliance across the platform.

    summary: |
      At Megvii Inc., I focused on developing state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions for large-scale computer vision challenges. I played a central role in designing and optimizing deep learning models for complex image recognition tasks, including building custom neural networks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of car license plate recognition systems. Through reverse engineering and advanced algorithm design, I improved model execution efficiency by 10x and increased recognition precision.

      I also contributed to large-scale dataset construction, leading efforts in building the Objects 365 Large Scale Image Dataset. By implementing a pre-labeling system utilizing the COCO dataset, I boosted labeling efficiency by 25%, accelerating data collection for use in AI training. The dataset became a foundational resource for researchers globally and was presented at ICCV 2019.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
